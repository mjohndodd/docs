title: "Create Offers - START HERE"

Offers are comprised of several components:

- Offer custom fields
- Custom offer tokens
- Offer templates

We recommend creating each component in the above order, as each one influences the next.

## View offer settings

Admins can view and update all offer settings, including the list of offer templates, offer custom fields, offer tokens, and conditional offer sections, from the Offers Admin settings page.

Steps to reach this page in your Gem account:

1. Select your account at the bottom of the main sidebar, then select the Admin settings option in the dropdown.
2. Select the Gem ATS header.
3. Select the Offers tab.
4. Select any of the headers on this page to view the list of offer templates, offer custom fields, offer tokens, and conditional offer sections.

## Offer token types

There are three types of offer tokens in Gem, as listed in the **Offer tokens** section.

- **Default tokens**: A list of standard fields typically associated with job offers, including candidate email, company name, department, job title, base pay, expiration date, and more. These tokens automatically insert the correct variable when the offer letter is generated, such as the candidate's first name.
- **E-signature tokens**: An offer token associated with e-signature information, such as the e-signature date, e-signature text, signatory, or other fields. These tokens are converted to fields in your e-signature provider when the offer is sent to a candidate, such as the e-signature date.
- **Custom offer tokens**: Admins can create custom offer tokens to add variables that aren’t already included in the list of default offer tokens. For example, a unique offer perk that may vary based on the hire’s level, such as a relocation stipend. For instructions to add custom offer tokens, see the [**<u>Create new custom offer tokens</u>**](https://help.gem.com/external/gem-ats-offer-templates-tokens#block-2b8374f2dd8480eb8d0bc1627cab2f67) section.
