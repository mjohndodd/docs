Gem allows you to quickly generate personalized offer letters for every role in your organization, using a combination of offer templates, offer custom fields, and custom offer tokens.

This article is the first in a series which explores the various components which allow you to personalize your offers in Gem. In this first instalment we'll cover what each of these offer components is for, and where admins need to look in Gem to see and create/edit them. Follow the links below, or at the end of the article, to read about how to create each of the individual components.

## Requirements

- Your team uses Gem ATS.
- Admin access is required to view and/or create any of the above offer components.

## What makes up an offer?

You can personalize offers in Gem using three components:

- Offer custom fields
- Custom offer tokens
- Offer templates

### Offer custom fields

Placeholders for valuable information beyond the default set of offer fields, allowing you to add additional fields to an offer letter. For example, you might add offer custom fields for the department sub-type, or if this is a backfill vs. a new hire.

### Custom offer tokens

Dynamic variables that automatically insert the correct value when the offer letter is generated. For example, you can add offer tokens for base pay, office location, or candidate email, so these details automatically populate in place of the tokens in the offer letter.

### Offer templates

Reusable offer letters that include standard offer content. For example, you might create a Sales offer template that includes your organization’s standard introduction, compensation overview, and any policies specific to Sales roles.

We recommend creating each component in the above order, as each one influences the next.

## View offer settings

Admins can view and update all offer settings, including the list of offer templates, offer custom fields, offer tokens, and **_conditional offer sections_**, from the Offers Admin settings page.

Steps to reach this page in your Gem account:

1. Select your account at the bottom of the main sidebar, then select the Admin settings option in the dropdown.
2. Select the Gem ATS header.
3. Select the Offers tab.
4. Select any of the headers on this page to view the list of offer templates, offer custom fields, offer tokens, and conditional offer sections.
