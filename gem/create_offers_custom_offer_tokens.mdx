## Offer token types

There are three types of offer tokens in Gem, as listed in the **Offer tokens** section.

- **Default tokens**: A list of standard fields typically associated with job offers, including candidate email, company name, department, job title, base pay, expiration date, and more. These tokens automatically insert the correct variable when the offer letter is generated, such as the candidate's first name.
- **E-signature tokens**: An offer token associated with e-signature information, such as the e-signature date, e-signature text, signatory, or other fields. These tokens are converted to fields in your e-signature provider when the offer is sent to a candidate, such as the e-signature date.
- **Custom offer tokens**: Admins can create custom offer tokens to add variables that aren’t already included in the list of default offer tokens. For example, a unique offer perk that may vary based on the hire’s level, such as a relocation stipend. For instructions to add custom offer tokens, see the [**<u>Create new custom offer tokens</u>**](https://help.gem.com/external/gem-ats-offer-templates-tokens#block-2b8374f2dd8480eb8d0bc1627cab2f67) section.
